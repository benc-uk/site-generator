# Markdown Simple Static Site Generator

This is a very simple markdown to HTML generator for creating static sites. It can be used for anything but was created with personal notes & snippets and documentation in mind.

Yes there are MANY other static site generators, but this one is mine, it does what I need

Goals:

- Convert markdown to HTML
- Index folders, creating index.html as it goes
- Use custom themes, wow!
- Single static binary
- Minimal config

Use cases & key features:

- Log personal work
- Notekeeping
- Informal docs
- Code snippets

# Templates

See the [example template](./templates/example.html) for the basics of how to build your own. [Go templates](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template) are used, and the file is expected to be a single HTML file, preferably with an embedded stylesheet.

The `default.html` template provides more details on how to style the output, and is embedded into the binary by default
